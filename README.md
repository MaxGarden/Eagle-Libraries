# Eagle CAD Libraries

**This repository with my Eagle CAD libraries is not actively maintained anymore
and only kept for documentation (and due to dependencies of some other
projects).**

Eagle CAD version 7 was used to create these libraries. Please do not report
errors due to incompatibilities with newer versions of Eagle CAD.
I do not support the price and product policy of Autodesk and therefore have
moved from Eagle CAD to the free and open source KiCad. I can only recommend you
to do the same.
